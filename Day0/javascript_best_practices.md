~~~
all the learning and things boil down to consistency and time 

giving extra time extra effort 

experimenting and going all the day 

out of protocol go out of protocol 

learning from others and interacting 

Build projects write blogs this is a priority 

make tutorials 

teach others 

experiment and have faith
